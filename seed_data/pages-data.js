Use red paint or nail polish to make it look like you’re bleeding. Then draw stitches with a black marker. If you need to make it even more distracting, squeeze an ice cube in the other hand at the same time; Gently snap a rubber band on your wrist each time you feel like hurting yourself. This might cause some minor temporary pain but it causes less permanent damage than cutting, burning, or mutilating yourself; Gently dig your fingernails into your arm without breaking the skin; Draw faces of people you hate on balloons and then pop them; Write letters to people you hate or to people who have hurt you. Tell them what they did to you and tell them why you hate them. Then throw the letters away or save them to read later;Throw foam balls, rolled-up socks, or pillows against the wall as hard as you can; Scream as loud as you can into a pillow or scream someplace where you won’t draw the attention of other people, like at a loud concert or in your car; Stick pins in a doll instead of hurting yourself. You can make a doll with some rolled-up socks or a foam ball and some markers. Or you can buy a doll in a store for the specific purpose of sticking pins in it. Buy one that’s soft and easy to stick; Cry. Sometimes people do other things instead of crying because they’re afraid that if they start to cry, they’ll never stop. This never happens. In fact, the truth is that crying can make you feel better because it releases stress hormones; Go exercise. Go to the gym or yoga studio and take out your pain and frustration doing something healthy. Go for a long walk or a long run. Use all of that destructive energy you feel in a positive way",

        list: "Listen to soothing music. This can be anything that works for you. It might be music with singing or without. Go online to sample some soothing music before you buy it, and listen to a wide variety of genres to determine which ones help you relax. Then download the music on your smartphone so you can listen to it anywhere you want; Listen to audio books. Many public libraries will let you borrow books on CDs or temporarily download audio books. Borrow a few to see if they help you relax. You don’t even have to pay attention to the story line. Sometimes just listening to the sound of someone talking can be very relaxing. Again, keep some of these recordings with you in your car or loaded on your smartphone; Turn on the television and just listen. Find a show that’s boring or sedate, not something agitating like the news. Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down, andthen close your eyes and just listen. Make sure you turn the volume down to a level that’s not too loud. Many years ago, there was a show on public television featuring a painter named Bob Ross. His voice was so soothing and relaxing that many people reported falling asleep while watching him. Find a show likethis that will help you relax; Listen to a soothing podcast or video online, or find a soothing talk show on the radio. Remember—a soothing podcast or talk show, not something that’s going to make you upset or angry. Again, stay away from political talk shows and the news. Find something neutral in discussion, like the TED Talks series online or This American Life on public radio. Again, sometimes just listening to someone else talk can be relaxing. Bookmark the links or download your favorite podcasts on your smartphone so you can listen to them when you’re feeling upset or angry; Open your window and listen to the peaceful sounds outside. Or, if you live in aplace without relaxing sounds outside, go visit a place with relaxing sounds,such as a park; Listen to a recording of nature sounds, such as birds and other wildlife. You can often download these online and then take them with you to listen on your smartphone; Listen to a white-noise machine. White noise is a sound that blocks out other distracting sounds. You can buy a machine that makes white noise with circulating air, turn on a fan to block out distracting sounds, or download awhite-noise app on your smartphone. Some white-noise machines and apps even have other recorded sounds on them, such as the sounds of birds,waterfalls, and rain forests. Many people find these sounds very relaxing; Listen to the sound of a personal water fountain. These small electronic fountains can be bought online and many people find the sound of the trickling water in their homes to be very soothing; Listen to a recording of a meditation or relaxation exercise. Exercises such as these will help you imagine yourself relaxing in many different ways. Other recorded exercises can even teach you self-hypnosis techniques to help you relax; Listen to the sound of rushing or trickling water. Maybe your local park has a waterfall, or the nearby mall has a fountain. Or maybe just sit in your bathroom with the water running for a few minutes",

Many people who have survived physical and sexual abuse do not want to be touched by anyone. This is understandable. But not all types of massage require you to take off your clothes. Some techniques, such as traditional Japanese shiatsu massage, simply require you to wear loose-fitting clothes. A shoulder and neck massage, received while seated in a massage chair, can also be done without removing any clothes. If this is a concern for you, just ask the massage therapist what kind of massage would be best to have while wearing your clothes; Massage yourself. Sometimes just rubbing your own sore muscles is very pleasing; Play with your pet; Wear your most comfortable clothes, like your favorite worn-in T-shirt, baggy sweat suit, or old jeans.",

It's perfectly acceptable to reconsider your faith if it no longer gives you the peace and strength it once did.; Consider how your beliefs in a higher power give you strength? How does it make you feel? How do they affect your interactions with others and how do you fortify your beliefs further? Write your answers down.;It's important to remember that belief in a higher power goes beyond just one god or many gods. Take a moment to look at the world around you and think about how we are all connected. The things that make up our bodies also make up the animals, plants, and earth that are with us. Look up and think about the huge universe we are in, with billions of stars shining in space. Look down and think about the tiny particles that move faster than we can understand.
