      "To begin, sit in a comfortable chair with your feet and hands resting comfortably. Close your eyes. Take a slow, long breath in through your nose. Feel your belly expand like a balloon as you breathe in. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then release it slowly through your mouth. Feel your belly collapse like a balloon losing its air. Again, take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. One more time: take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. Now begin to take slow, long breaths without holding them, and continue to breathe smoothly for the rest of this exercise.;Now, with your eyes closed, imagine that you enter your safe place using all of your senses to ground yourself in the scene.;First, look around using your imaginary sense of sight. What does this place look like? Is it daytime or nighttime? Is it sunny or cloudy? Notice the details. Are you alone or are there other people or animals? What are they doing? If you’re outside, look up and notice the sky. Look out at the horizon. If you’re inside, notice what the walls and the furniture look like. Is the room light or dark? Choose something soothing to look at. Then continue looking for a few seconds using your imaginary sense of sight.;Next, use your imaginary sense of hearing. What do you hear? Do you hear other people or animals? Do you hear music? Do you hear the wind or the ocean?;Choose something soothing to hear. Then listen for a few seconds using your imaginary sense of hearing.;Then use your imaginary sense of smell. If you’re inside, what does it smell like? Does it smell fresh? Do you have a fire burning that you can smell? Or, if you’re outside, can you smell the air, the grass, the ocean, or the flowers? Choose to smell something soothing in your scene. Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense of smell.;Next, notice if you can feel anything with your imaginary sense of touch. What are you sitting or standing on in your scene? Can you feel the wind? Can you feel something you’re touching in the scene? Choose to touch something soothing in your scene. Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense of touch.;Last, use your imaginary sense of taste. Are you eating or drinking anything in this scene? Choose something soothing to taste. Then take a few seconds to use your imaginary sense of taste.;Now take a few more seconds to explore your safe place using all of your imaginary senses. Recognize how safe and relaxed you feel here. Remember that you can come back to this place in your imagination whenever you need to feel safe and relaxed. You can also come back whenever you’re feeling sad, angry, restless, or in pain. Look around one last time to remember what it looks like.;Now keep your eyes closed and return your focus to your breathing. Again, take some slow, long breaths in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Then, when you feel ready, open your eyes and return your focus to the room.",

      "To begin, sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting comfortably, either on the arms of the chair or in your lap. Close your eyes. Take a slow, long breath in through your nose. Feel your belly expand like a balloon as you breathe in. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then release it slowly through your mouth. Feel your belly collapse like a balloon losing its air. Again, take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. One more time: take a slow, long breath in through your nose and feel your stomach expand. Hold it for five seconds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then exhale slowly through your mouth. Now begin to take slow, long breaths without holding them, and continue to breathe smoothly for the rest of this exercise.;Now, with your eyes still closed, imagine that a white beam of light shines down from the sky like a bright laser and lands on the very top of your head. Notice how warm and soothing the light makes you feel. This could be a light from God, the universe, or whatever power makes you feel comfortable. As you continue to breathe smoothly, taking slow, long breaths, notice how the light makes you feel more and more relaxed as it continues to shine on the top of your head. Now, slowly, the warm, white light begins to spread over the top of your head like soothing water. And as it does, the light begins to loosen any muscle tension that you’re feeling on the top of your head. Slowly, the light begins to slide down your body, and as it moves across your forehead, all the muscle tension there is released. Then the white light continues down past your ears, the back of your head, your eyes, nose, mouth, and chin, and it continues to release any tension you’re holding there. Notice how pleasantly warm your forehead feels. Now, slowly, imagine that the light begins to move down your neck and over your shoulders, releasing any muscle tension. Then the light slowly proceeds down both of your arms and the front and back of your torso. Feel the muscles in your upper and lower back release. Notice the soothing sensation of the white light as it moves across your chest and stomach. Feel the muscles in your arms release as the light moves down to your forearms and then across both sides of your hands to your fingertips. Now notice the light moving down through your pelvis and buttocks and feel the tension being released. Again, feel the light move like soothing water across your upper and lower legs until it spreads across both the upper and lower surfaces of your feet. Feel all of the tension leaving the muscles of your body as the white light makes your body feel warm and relaxed.;Continue to notice how peaceful and calm you feel as you continue to take slow, long, smooth breaths. Observe how your stomach continues to expand as you inhale, and feel it deflate as you exhale. Now, as you continue breathing, silently think to yourself “breathe in” as you inhale, and then silently think your cue word as you exhale. [If your cue word is something other than “relax,” use that word in the following instructions.] Slowly inhale and think: “breathe in.” Slowly exhale and think: “relax.” As you do, notice your entire body feeling relaxed at the same time. Feel all the muscle tension in your body being released as you focus on your cue word. Again, inhale and think: “breathe in.” Exhale and think: “relax.” Notice your entire body releasing any muscle tension. Again, inhale…“breathe in.” Exhale…“relax.” Feel all the tension in your body releasing.;Continue breathing and thinking these words at your own pace for several minutes. With each breath, notice how relaxed your entire body feels. When your mind begins to wander, return your focus to the words “breathe in” and “relax.”",

      "Sit in a comfortable chair. Turn off any distractions, like your phone, radio, computer, and television. Take slow, long breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach expand like a balloon each time you breath in and feel it deflate each time you exhale. Now, as you continue to breathe, simply listen.;Listen to any sounds you hear outside your home, inside your home, and inside your own body. Count each sound that you hear. When you get distracted, return your focus to listening. Maybe you hear cars, people, or airplanes outside. Perhaps you hear a clock ticking or a fan blowing inside. Or maybe you hear the sound of your own heart beating inside your body.;Actively and carefully listen to your environment and count as many sounds as you can. Try this exercise for five minutes and notice how you feel afterward.",

    content: "To begin, find a comfortable place to sit in a room where you won’t be disturbed for as long as you’ve set your timer. Turn off any distracting sounds. Take a few slow, long breaths and relax. Place one hand on your stomach and imagine your belly filling up with air as you breathe instead of your lungs. Now slowly breathe in through your nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth as if you’re blowing out birthday candles. Feel your stomach rise and fall as you breathe. Imagine your belly filling up with air like a balloon as you breathe in, and then feel it effortlessly deflate as you breathe out. Feel the breath moving in across your nostrils, and then feel your breath blowing out across your lips. As you breathe, notice the sensations in your body. Feel your lungs fill up with air. Notice the weight of your body resting on whatever you’re sitting on. With each breath, notice how your body feels more and more relaxed.;Now, as you continue to breathe, begin counting your breaths each time you exhale. You can count either silently to yourself or aloud. Count each exhalation until you reach 4 and then begin counting at 1 again. To begin, breathe in slowly through your nose and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Count 1. Again, breathe in slowly through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. Count 2. Repeat, breathing in slowly through your nose, and then slowly exhale. Count 3. Last time—breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Count 4. Now begin counting at 1 again.;When your mind begins to wander and you catch yourself thinking of something else, return your focus to counting your breaths. Try not to criticize yourself for getting distracted. Just keep taking slow breaths into your belly, in and out. Imagine filling up your belly with air like a balloon. Feel it rising with each inhalation and falling with each exhalation. Keep counting each breath, and with each exhale, feel your body relaxing, deeper and deeper.;Keep breathing until your alarm goes off, and then slowly return your focus to the room."

    content: "Ideally, you should first practice this technique while you are relaxed and undisturbed by emotions. Find a comfortable place to sit, and while keeping your eyes open, simply move your eyes back and forth from side to side. Move your eyes at a comfortable rate of approximately one back-and-forth movement per second, as if you were watching a fast game of ping-pong. Do your best not to move your head, just allow your eyes to move from side to side, looking from one corner of the room to the other. Do this for about thirty seconds. Get used to the movement. Stop if you feel any excessive eye strain or pain, or slow the movement to a more comfortable pace.;Next, practice using this technique with a mildly disturbing memory. Recall the memory and the emotional response that it caused. Do your best to rate the emotional distress on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst distress you can imagine. Also, note any stress or strain that the memory causes in your body. Now use the side-to-side eye movement for about thirty seconds. As you move your eyes, don’t try to hold on to the disturbing memory; rather, let whatever memory or feeling comes up next to just appear naturally. After about thirty seconds, note any changes in how you feel emotionally or physically. Then try the technique again, starting again from the original disturbing memory and letting whatever comes up during those thirty seconds to appear naturally. Then again, note any changes in how you feel emotionally or physically. Try this for about four or five attempts and note any improvements in how you feel emotionally or physically.;If you did notice any improvements while practicing this technique, try it the next time you experience a painful or heightened emotional response to something. Identify what the most bothersome part of the event was, what emotion was most painful, or what triggered the painful emotion. Start from there. If you are somewhere private and can move your eyes from side to side without calling unwanted attention to yourself, sit down and try using the technique wherever you are. Otherwise, if you cannot openly move your eyes from side to side, try closing your eyes and using the same technique. Quickly move your eyes back and forth for about thirty seconds with your eyelids closed, note any changes in how you feel emotionally or physically, and then repeat the technique three or four times if necessary. Again, for each thirty-second interval, allow whatever memories or thoughts that come up to do so naturally. Then when you restart, go back to the original painful memory or emotion.;One of the authors of this workbook often recommends this technique to help with occasional insomnia and anxious thoughts at bedtime. Try it the next time you’re having trouble sleeping. With your eyelids closed and while lying down, move your eyes back and forth in the same way you practiced above for about thirty seconds. Imagine “erasing” whatever thoughts or memories are bothering you as your eyes move from side to side. Again, continue using the technique for four or five attempts, then try sleeping again.",

    content: "In order to trigger the diving response to help you relax, it is recommended that you place a very cold, wet towel on your forehead or cheeks, or to use a semimelted ice pack wrapped in a towel. (Never place a fully frozen ice pack directly on your skin; always keep the ice pack wrapped to avoid injury.) Try one of these techniques rather than submerging your full face in a tub of very cold water. Placing the very cold compress on your forehead or your cheeks affects the trigeminal nerve in your face in a way that is similar to immersing your face in very cold water. (If you experience any pain while doing this, stop immediately.) If you’re using a cold wet towel, make sure it is colder than 70 degrees Fahrenheit (below 21 degrees Celsius) in order to trigger the diving response. Next, in order to further simulate submerging your face in water, hold your breath for several seconds (or for as long as is comfortable) while maintaining the cold compress on your forehead or cheeks. However, never do anything else to purposely block your ability to breathe; doing so can lead to feeling faint, passing out, or even death.",

    content: "It is recommended that instead of holding your hand in a bucket of ice water for two to four minutes, you instead run your hands under very cold water or hold onto a covered ice pack for the same amount of time. (Finding a bucket of ice water when you are very distressed is unlikely, especially if you are not at home, and it is more likely that you will have access to an ice pack or very cold water. Or, if neither of those is available, hold a very cold can of soda or a very cold bottle of water.) Make the temperature of the cold water or ice pack as cold as you can tolerate, between 32 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (0 and 10 degrees Celsius). It is expected that you will experience a mild to moderate amount of discomfort, but it should never cause you a high level of pain. If at any point you do experience a great amount of pain or discomfort, stop immediately. Set a timer on your smartphone for no more than four minutes and do your best to tolerate the discomfort. If you need something else to focus on during the exercise, practice your mindful breathing technique."

    content: "To perform HIIT exercises, consider using a treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical trainer, stair-climber, rowing machine, or other piece of equipment that allows you to exert yourself at an intensive exertion level for several minutes. (If you need help using a piece of equipment that you’re not familiar with, first consult a physical fitness expert.) However, if you don’t have access to equipment like this, consider other forms of high-intensity exercise, such as running sprints outside, running in place, skipping rope, performing “burpees,” or even doing exercises like jumping jacks.;Before beginning each set of HIIT exercise, consider warming up with stretching or performing a set of slow movements to loosen and warm your muscles. As with starting any new exercise regimen, “start low and go slow,” which means start with a lower amount of total exercise time and don’t immediately aim to maintain 90 percent of your maximum heart rate while exercising if that sounds too hard or too intimidating. Instead, maybe start with thirty seconds of high-intensity exercise, aiming to maintain only 75 percent of your maximum heart rate while exercising (or moderate intensity using the “talk test”), followed by two minutes of moving at a slower pace, allowing your heart rate to slow down and your breathing to become easier. Later, with improved strength and endurance, you can increase your time, intensity level, and targeted heart rate.;Also, consider adjusting the number of paired intervals that you will be performing. Maybe when you’re just beginning HIIT, you can only perform three or four “intense-moderate” paired intervals of one minute (for six to eight minutes of total exercise time). Then as you gain stamina and experience, maybe you can build up to one minute of five or six paired intervals (for ten to twelve minutes of total exercise time). Remember, the level at which you begin exercising and the amount you progress is largely going to be determined by your age, activity level, medical conditions, and consistency of exercise. Keep your goals and expectations reasonable, and don’t expect to do too much, too quickly.;Finally, consider these suggestions too. One fitness writer who interviewed expert HIIT trainers recommends that you avoid seven common mistakes that people sometimes make when starting a HIIT exercise regimen (Migala, 2017): (1) Don’t skip performing a warm-up before exercising. (2) Don’t exercise for longer than twenty or thirty minutes each time. (3) Make sure you exert yourself to a high intensity level during the periods of exertion in order to gain the benefits of HIIT. (4) Between each period of high-intensity exertion make sure you slow down and take enough time to recover so that you can then push yourself again during the next period of exertion. (5) Whichever exercise you are using to perform HIIT, make sure that the movements are simple, because you will tire quickly and lose the ability to do any movements that are too complex. (6) Don’t extend the length of your overall workouts too quickly, such as going from five minutes to twenty minutes in the first week; rather, allow your body the time it needs to gain strength before you push it harder. And lastly, (7) don’t perform HIIT exercise routines more than two or three times each week, because your body needs time to recover in between workouts."

Feel the breath moving in across your nostrils, and then feel your breath blowing out across your lips, as if you’re blowing out birthday candles.;Now, as you continue to breathe, begin counting the length of both your inhalations and exhalations. Count silently to yourself as you watch your timer. As you slowly breathe in, think: “In, 2.” Then as you start to breathe out, think: “Out, 2, 3, 4.” Then start the pattern again: “In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4.” Continue to silently pace your breaths with your timer, doing your best to take slow, steady breaths. Slow, steady breaths. Do your best not to breathe too quickly. Remember, you do not have to fill up your entire lung capacity. Rather, think of slow breaths moving in and out of your belly, gently filling it up with air like a balloon. “In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4.” When your mind gets distracted, or when you lose count of your breaths, just gently return your focus to your breath moving in and out of your belly, or refocus on your timer. “In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4.”;Keep breathing until your timer goes off, and then slowly return your focus to the room."

    content: "Unfortunately, most people are not aware of the muscle tension that they hold in their bodies. The next time you’re in a group of people, notice how many people struggle with muscle tension in their bodies. Look for the hunched shoulders, the poor posture, the tight jaws, the clenched fists, and the grimaces on so many faces. Unfortunately, many of us have become so used to carrying tension in our bodies that we just accept it as being “normal.” But whether it’s normal or not, it can still be corrected in most cases.;Progressive muscle relaxation focuses on helping you recognize the difference between a tight, tense feeling in your muscles versus a loose, relaxed feeling. In order to help you recognize the sensations more easily, progressive muscle relaxation focuses on tensing and releasing small groups of muscles, one at a time. By slowly tensing and relaxing that group of muscles, you learn to recognize the difference, and in the future, when you do hold tension in those muscles, you’ll be able to more easily spot the tension and release it. Using the technique below, you’ll move through your entire body, tensing and releasing small groups of muscles, learning to recognize and release tension, as well as to create muscular relaxation.;As you move through each muscle group, you’ll tighten the muscles for approximately five seconds, and then quickly release the muscle tension. It’s important that you release the tension as quickly as you can so that you’re better able to distinguish the relaxed feeling. Then take approximately fifteen to thirty seconds to notice the feeling of your muscles releasing and relaxing. Then tighten and release the same group of muscles again, and continue to notice the difference between the tight feeling and the relaxed feeling. In general, tighten and release each group of muscles at least twice, but if you need additional focus on a particular group of muscles to help them release, you can tighten and release them up to five times. You can practice progressive muscle relaxation while you are either seated or lying down, and with practice, you can even tense and release some muscles on the go while you are walking and standing.;Before beginning, there are three parts of general instructions to consider. First, you need to determine the type of tensing you’re going to do. There are three kinds: active tensing, threshold tensing, and passive tensing. They are all explained below. Second, pick a verbal cue to use while you are relaxing. Some suggestions are provided. By repeatedly pairing a verbal cue with the act of relaxing your muscles, you can eventually train your muscles to relax simply by using your verbal cue. And third, decide whether you are using the basic procedure for progressive muscle relaxation or the shorthand procedure. When you are first learning how to tense and release your muscle groups, it is recommended that you use the basic procedure for several weeks until you are able to both easily notice muscle tension and effectively release it. Then you can begin using the shorthand procedure, which conglomerates muscles into several larger groups to relax at the same time. Consider recording either of the scripts on your smartphone so that you can close your eyes and relax while performing progressive muscle relaxation.;Before beginning progressive muscle relaxation, consider your physical limitations—if any—and proceed with extra caution if you currently have any back, neck, joint, or shoulder pain. If you have any doubts about your ability to tense and release muscles in your body, talk with a medical care provider before you begin. Also, if you are pregnant or prone to fainting, speak with a medical professional before trying this technique. And, even if your health is not a concern, proceed with caution as you tense muscles in your back, neck, and even your feet. Never tighten these areas so much that they cause you pain."
