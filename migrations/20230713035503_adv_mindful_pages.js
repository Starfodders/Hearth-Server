          "The three tasks in the Daily Regimen are concepts we’ve covered in the previous sections or units. Practice mindful breathing for 3-5 minutes a day at minimum, counting your breathes and focusing on the physical sensation of inhaling and exhaling, taking note of distracting thoughts and defusing them. Then at the end of each mindful breathing period you employ self-compassion meditation, repeating words of affirmation and kindness to yourself. Then practice wise-mind meditation to channel your intuition, finding balance in your emotional and reasonable mind to make the best decisions for yourself.",

It can take the form of boredom, fear, judgment.;Sleepiness refers to the feeling of fatigue, feeling dull or heavy. Or it can be an avoidance of something happening in your mind or body.;Restlessness opposes sleepiness and can feel like an uncomfortable, demanding storm of thoughts, feelings, and sensations.;Doubt is the inner voice resisting the present moment, often evoking feelings of fear and negativity.",

          "Hindrances can appear as obstacle at first, but can in reality become your wisest teacher. Focus on the hindrance and try to name it, is it doubt, desire, or something else? Acknowledge it, try to understand where it comes from. If it is restlessness, does it stem from a childhood criticism of being too ‘idle’?  Or if it is sleepiness, is it your body telling you that you need to rearrange your schedule to reprioritize sleep? Here are some other general guidelines for working with the Five Hindrances.;For Desire, recall that no matter how many times you get what you desire, you always want more. Let this wisdom empower you to resist the temptation of desire and learn from it instead.;For Aversion, recognize anger and ill will as some of your strongest teachers. Resolve to learn from them. At times, it also helps if you can work to balance them by developing thoughts of compassion, kindness, and forgiveness.;For Sleepiness, know it is as a powerful condition that demands your full attention. It can help to sit up straight, splash water on your face, take a break, or do something active.;For Restlessness, it can help to sharpen your concentration. Take a more narrow focus such as putting the attention onto the tip of your nose for practicing mindful breathing.;For Doubt, it can help to concentrate on the present moment with resolve and steadiness. You can try to communicate with others who practice mindfulness such as teachers or students and discuss how they manage their doubt.",

We can improve our health through these positive qualities by embodying a deep friendliness and welcoming spirit, filled with forgiveness and unconditional love, like a mother caring for her child. All you need to do is admit and allow feelings of kindness and compassion to flow through you while paying attention mindfully.

If you feel comfortable closing your eyes, do so to help you relax.;Now locate the bottom of your sternum on your rib cage. You can do this by touching the bone at the center of your chest and then following it down toward your abdomen until the bone ends. Now place one hand on your abdomen between the bottom of your sternum and your belly button. This is the center of wise mind.;Take a few slow, long breaths and relax. Now slowly breathe in through your nose and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Feel your abdomen rise and fall as you breathe. Imagine your belly filling up with air like a balloon as you breathe in, and then feel it deflate as you breathe out. Feel the breath moving in across your nostrils and then feel your breath blowing out across your lips, as if you’re blowing out candles. As you breathe, notice any sensations in your body. Feel your lungs fill up with air. Notice the weight of your body as it rests on the seat in which you’re sitting. With each breath, notice how your body feels, and allow your body to become more and more relaxed.;Now, as you continue to breathe, let your attention focus on the spot underneath your hand. Let your attention focus on the center of wise mind. Continue to take slow, long breaths. If you have any distracting thoughts, just allow those thoughts to leave you without fighting them and without getting stuck on them. Continue to breathe and focus on the center of wise mind. Feel your hand resting on your stomach.;As you focus your attention on your center of wise mind, notice what appears. If you’ve had any troubling thoughts, problems, or decisions that you have to make in your life, think about them for a few seconds. Then ask your center of wise mind what you should do about these problems or decisions. Ask your inner intuitive self for guidance, and then notice what thoughts or solutions arise out of your center of wise mind. Don’t judge whatever answers you receive. Just note them to yourself and keep breathing. Continue to focus your attention on your center of wise mind. If no thoughts or answers come to your questions, just continue breathing.;Now continue to notice your breath rising and falling.

Do your best to imagine yourself in that scene. After you do, start to become aware of the judgments that you’re having, just like in the last exercises in which you wrote down your judgments. Start to observe the judgments that are coming up, whatever they are. Don’t try to stop your thoughts, and do your best not to criticize yourself for any of the judgments.

Do your best to watch the judgments arise and disappear without getting hooked into them and without criticizing yourself.

If the judgments come very quickly, do your best to watch them all disappear without getting hooked on any of them.

Take a few slow, long breaths, close your eyes, and relax.;Now, keeping your eyes closed, focus your attention on the weight of your body as it rests on the seat in which you’re sitting. Notice the weight of your feet and legs resting on the ground. Notice the weight of your hands and arms resting. Notice the weight of your head resting on top of your neck. Mentally scan your body from head to toe and notice any sensations that you feel. Take your time.;Now notice any tension you might be feeling anywhere in your body, and imagine the tension melting away like wax in the hot sun. Again, take your time to scan your body for any tension, and keep taking slow, deep breaths.;When you are finished scanning your body, move your focus to your thoughts and judgments. Just notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to float away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;Now redirect your attention to your sense of hearing. Notice any sounds that you can hear coming from outside your room, and note to yourself what they are. Now become aware of any sounds you hear coming from inside the room, and note to yourself what they are. Try to notice even small sounds, such as the ticking of a clock, the sound of the wind, or the beating of your heart. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your sense of hearing. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing.;When you are finished noticing any sounds, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and judgments. Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to float away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths.;Now, once again, redirect your attention. This time, put your focus on your sense of smell. Notice any smells that are in the room, pleasant or otherwise. If you don’t notice any smells, just become aware of the flow of air moving into your nostrils as you breathe in through your nose. Try your best to maintain your focus on your sense of smell. If you become distracted by any thoughts, return your focus to your nose. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, deep breaths.;When you are finished noticing any smells, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and judgments.

Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;Now redirect your attention to your sense of touch. Notice the sensation of whatever your hands are resting on. Or, keeping your eyes closed, reach out with one of your hands to touch an object that is within reach. Or, if there is no object within reach, touch the chair you’re sitting in or touch your leg. Notice what the object feels like. Notice if it’s smooth or rough. Notice if it’s pliable or rigid. Notice if it’s soft or solid. Notice what the sensations feel like on the skin of your fingertips. If your thoughts begin to distract you, simply return your focus to the object that you’re touching. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;When you are finished noticing any touch sensations, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and judgments. Notice any thoughts or judgments that arise in your mind, and when they do, allow them to float away by whichever means you found successful in the last exercises. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;Now, slowly, open your eyes. Keep breathing slow, deep breaths. Take a few minutes to focus your visual attention on the room you’re sitting in. Notice the objects that are in the room. Notice how light or dark the room is. Notice the different colors that are in the room. Notice where you are in the room. Move your head to look around. Take in all the visual information that you can. If your thoughts begin to distract you, simply return your focus to the room you’re looking at. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;When you have finished noticing any visual sensations, once again redirect your focus to your thoughts and judgments. But this time, keep your eyes open. Pick a few objects in the room to focus on. But in your mind, continue to notice any thoughts and judgments that arise, and when they do, allow them to float away. Allow the thoughts and judgments to leave you without getting stuck on them. If you need to close your eyes to do this, that’s okay. But open your eyes once the thoughts have floated away, and return your focus to the room you’re in. Continue to monitor your thoughts and judgments and continue to let them go without getting stuck on them. Take a minute to do this, and keep breathing slow, long breaths.;When you’ve finished, if you still have time left, continue to switch your focus between your thoughts and judgments and what you notice visually.
